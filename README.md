## TRESP: Modeling Group-level Public Sentiment in Social Networks through Topic and Role Enhancement


## Overview
TRESP is a group-level public sentiment prediction model, that predicts emotional scores for positive, negative, and neutral emotions. Additionally, the prediction range can be refined by adjusting the size of the time window.
